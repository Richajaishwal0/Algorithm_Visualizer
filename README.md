# Algorithm Visualizer

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React.

Explore more than 24 algorithms with step-by-step visualization, simplifying the learning process and making it more engaging for better understanding.

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

## Features

So far, there are 6 segments:

- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game
- Recursion Tree
- Turing Machine

A total of `24 algorithms` have been implemented so far, with more to be added in the future.

## Run Locally

Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. Then run:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

This will start the app at `http://localhost:3000/AlgorithmVisualizer`.
